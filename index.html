                    <p>The name "Alibi" comes from a short story by Oakland native Jack London. While a bit grim and violent, the tale centers on the overwhelming need to make the westing wind back home to Oakland - to a place of warmth and family (and bocce courts?).</p>
                    <p>Alibi Saloon & Taphouse is located in the thriving Uptown district of Oakland. Wood, iron, and slate make up the d√©cor that resonates with the industrial heritage of our city. We are equipped with a full bar, a variety of gourmet bites, an outdoor patio, and two indoor bocce courts. The Fox theater is less than one block away, and the 19th st. BART stop is across the street.</p>
                    <p>Make Westing is more a bar than restaurant and as such (according to the alcohol beverage control rules) no one under 21 is allowed, infants included. We do not host live music nor do we have DJs, with rare exceptions. For credit cards, we request a $10 minimum. As relates to credit cards - some banks will place a temporary double charge on certain cards only as a hold and will release the charge within 7-10 business days. We have no idea why they do this, but it happens often enough that we thought we should mention it. We have an ATM on site. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Make Westing is available for a wide variety of private functions. We offer catering services (see below), and we do have a semi-private space that we can block off for smaller groups - best for sizes between 20 and 30 or as a base for larger groups - though we do not take table reservations. The rate for the semi-private space ranges from $100 an hour Sunday through Wednesday, $150 an hour on Thursdays and $200 on Fridays and Saturdays (only until 10pm). We section the space (towards the back of the bar) from the main bar with stanchions and the area includes three high-top tables as well as a banquette and the back bar.</p>
                    <p>The only other area of Make Westing that we provide reservations for are the bocce courts. The courts are first come, first serve and are free. When there are others waiting, each group may play one game to seven and then give up the court to the next group in line. However, if you would like to rent the bocce courts, we do so at $50 per hour, per court, though we only rent one at a time so we can have the other open to the general public. </p>
                    <p>Generally, for parties we charge $22 per person, per hour for an open bar and $15 per person, per hour for wine and beer only, though we can/do offer open tabs (at regular, non-happy-hour pricing) or drink ticket options - usually either $6 and $11 a ticket depending on what level of beer or liquor you're looking to provide. For all liquor and catering packages we add 18% gratuity.</p>
                    <p>Finally, complete buyouts are available, but the costs vary dramatically based on time of day, day of week, time of year, length and complexity of the event, number of people, etc. Please contact us for more information.</p>
